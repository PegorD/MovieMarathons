            <h1>Hello!</h1>
            <section>
                <p>This website contains a list of some movie marathons that you and your friends can enjoy.</p>
            </section>
        </header>
        <section class="abouttext">
            <br /><br />
            The website was created as an exercise of skill in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery, so don’t take it seriously.<br /><br />
            The website's purpose is to list movie marathons for people to enjoy.<br /><br />
            The website doesn't have a complete and definitive list of marathons, and does not strive to have one.<br /><br />
            The list is comprised of movie marathons that the creator would enjoy, so not all movie genres will be covered.<br /><br /><br />
            Rules for what qualify as a movie marathon for this website:
            <ol>
                <li>The marathon must have at least two movies.</li>
                <li>
                    The marathon must NOT be comprised of movies with only one common denominator<br />
                    i.e. a movie marathon with movies directed by the same person or starring the same actor or same genre.*
                </li>
            </ol>
            <br /><br />
            If you have a movie marathon that you would like to see on the list please send an email to knowledgeablemammoth@gmail.com for review.<br /><br /><br />
            Your email must include:
            <ol>
                <li>Marathon name, in the same format as in the list.</li>
                <li>List of movies in the marathon along with their release year, and if there are extended cuts.</li>
                <li>Length of the entire marathon in hours, include the length of extended cuts if any.</li>
            </ol>
            <br /><br />

                    *The Cornetto Trilogy qualifies as a movie marathon for this website because the creators have stated that it is a trilogy,<br />
                    and since there is a thematic relationship between all three movies.<br />
